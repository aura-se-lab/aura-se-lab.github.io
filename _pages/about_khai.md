Hi, Iâ€™m Khai-Nguyen Nguyen, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at William & Mary, advised by Prof. Antonio Mastropaolo.
My research bridges AI, Software Engineering, and Explainability, with a focus on making Large Code Models more transparent and trustworthy.
I explore methods that move beyond token-level views to provide feature-level explanations aligned with how developers reason about code.
This work contributes to building AI systems that are less black-box, more interpretable, and supportive of real-world software development.
