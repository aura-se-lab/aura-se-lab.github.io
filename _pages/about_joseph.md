Hi there! -- I'm Joseph Call PhD Student in Computer Science. I'm a researcher at the intersection of machine learning and software engineering. My work focuses on developing resource-efficient approaches to machine learning, particularly in the context of code analysis and generation, while exploring ways to make AI more efficient and accessible.

About me: I'm originally from La Paz, Honduras and have always loved the unique culture and atmosphere there. In my free time, you can find me playing my guitar or trying out new recipes in the kitchen.
