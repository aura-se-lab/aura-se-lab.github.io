------------------

Hi, Iâ€™m Zaiyu Cheng, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at William & Mary. My research sits at the intersection of AI and Software Engineering, with a focus on using large language models for code tasks. I study how data integration, pre-training, and fine-tuning can boost model performance while reducing costs.

I hold a B.Sc. from the University of Birmingham (2022) and an M.Sc. from the University of Manchester (2024), where four years in the UK shaped both my academic path and personal outlook.

Outside research, I enjoy video games, running, and swimming, which help me stay active and maintain balance in life.
