------------------

Hi, Iâ€™m Zaiyu Cheng, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at William & Mary. My research lies at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering, with a particular focus on Large Language Models for code tasks. My work centers on exploring how data integration, pre-training, and fine-tuning strategies can enhance model capabilities while reducing training costs. 

Before starting my Ph.D., I earned a B.Sc. in Computer Science from the University of Birmingham in 2022 and an M.Sc. in Advanced Computer Science from the University of Manchester in 2024. I spent four memorable years in the UK, an experience that greatly shaped both my academic path and personal outlook. Today, with the same sense of curiosity and ambition, I am taking on a new and exciting journey.

Outside of academics, I enjoy video games, running, and swimming. Staying active helps me stay energized and healthy, while also giving me a good balance between work and life.
