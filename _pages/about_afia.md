Hi there! I’m Afia, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the College of William & Mary. I’m working with Dr. Antonio Mastropaolo at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering, focusing on Prompt Engineering and Large Language Models (LLMs). My research aims to design intelligent prompting strategies that make software engineering tasks, such as code understanding and generation more accurate and effective.

Prior to my Ph.D., I earned my bachelor’s degree in computer science and engineering from the American International University–Bangladesh (AIUB). After graduation, I worked as a Software Quality Assurance Engineer at DataBiz Software Limited, where I gained valuable hands-on experience in software testing, automation, and system reliability. Later, during my master’s in computer science at the University of South Dakota, I worked on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Lab, these experiences inspired me to explore how AI can enhance software engineering practices by improving automation and developer support.

Outside of research, I enjoy cooking, exploring new places, and photography. I’m passionate about continuous learning and inspired by how creativity and intelligent systems can come together to make software development more human-centered.
