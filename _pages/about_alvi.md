<h4>Md Zahidul Haque Alvi</h4>
------------------

Hi there! I’m Alvi, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at William & Mary. I’m working at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering, with a focus on Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques for large code models. My research explores how we can make these models more adaptable and efficient for real-world Software Engineering tasks.

Before starting my Ph.D., I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering at Sylhet Engineering College in Bangladesh. My interest in AI began during my final year through deep learning projects in NLP, and I’ve been passionate about the field ever since. I’ve worked as a Junior Machine Learning Engineer at Maya and later as a Junior Software Engineer at Graaho, gaining hands-on experience with real-world AI systems.

Outside research, I enjoy staying active and make time for the gym every day. I’m always happy to chat about AI, Software Engineering, or anything in between, feel free to reach out!
