Through disciplined engineering and real‑world validation, the lab turns research into dependable tools that improve everyday developer work. Led by Dr. Antonio Mastropaolo at William &amp; Mary, the lab develops approaches in: Explainability &amp; Interpretability -- methods that reveal how code models reason (rationales, traces, tests) so developers can inspect, trust, and debug automation. Efficiency &amp; Resource‑Aware Automation -- quantization, distillation, and PEFT to deliver low‑latency, memory‑light, cost‑aware automation measured on real workloads with reproducible metrics. Multi‑Agent LLMs for SE -- role‑aligned agents that plan, code, test, and review, coordinated to produce coherent, end‑to‑end developer assistance. Neurosymbolic AI for SE -- hybrid pipelines pairing LLMs with program analysis and constraints to produce interpretable, checkable fixes, tests, and designs. Task‑Aware Code Automation -- from issues, diffs, and traces to concise summaries, TODOs, and plans; models that reduce developer toil with actionable, repo‑aware guidance. </subtitle></feed>
