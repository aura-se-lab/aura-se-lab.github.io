<p>🎉 Congratulations to <a href="https://aura-se-lab.github.io/people/" target="_blank">Ben Trembley</a> for receiving W&M’s <em>Charles Center Summer Research Grant</em>! 👏</p>

<p>Ben’s research explores the intersection of software engineering, AI, and optimization, with a focus on cutting the cost of training large language models that enables software development automation (e.g., GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT). The work addresses the urgent need for resource‑efficient scaling as models grow to trillions of parameters.</p>
